;; An accumulator is a procedure that is called repeatedly with a single numeric argument
;; and accumulates its arguments into a sum. Each time it is called, it returns the
;; currently accumulated sum. Write a procedure make-accumulator that generates
;; accumulators, each maintaining an independent sum. The input to make-accumulator should
;; specify the initial value of the sum; for example
;;  (define A (make-accumulator 5))
;;  (A 10)
;;  15
;;  (A 10)
;;  25

(define (make-accumulator sum)
  (lambda (n)
    (set! sum (+ sum n))
    sum))

(define A (make-accumulator 5))
(A 10)
(A 10)
